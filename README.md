Quote ideas:

Love is in the air, and it smells like coffee. - unknown 

Today's good mood is sponsored by coffee

All you need is love, and more coffee

You can't buy happiness but you can buy coffee, and that's pretty close

Be kind. Be friendly. Be likable. But don't worry if someone doesn't like you. You won't be everyone's cup of tea, and that's okay. You can be someone's cup of coffee instead. And coffee is AWESOME!
